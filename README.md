## Personal
- Currently unemployed
- Dedicating my time to maintain my repos, and to finish the "base" of some non-posted repos
- Interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking
- Wish I dedicated more time to music, animation, and other forms of art
- Willing to contribute to innovative games that explore the concepts of non-Euclidean space/geometry, +3D games like [4D Miner](https://mashpoe.com/4d-miner), 1D and 0D games (for completeness)
- Have an "unhealthy obsession" with code refactoring. It's obvious from my GH activity 😂

## Repos
- When my PRs are merged, **I'll delete my corresponding fork**. Therefore, links to any of my forks may be [broken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) (not dead, because it's not permanent) in the future. The exception is [.files](https://github.com/Rudxain/dotfiles)
- All my repos have [semver](https://semver.org), except the ones that don't have versioning at all
- If I contribute to any of your repos, I hope you do the same for me and/or other people
