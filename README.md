# Meta (not FB, lol)
This file is still WIP, don't expect much :v

# About me
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Whatever thing I'm inspired to do at the moment. Usually my repos, but there's some stuff I haven't posted because they are VERY unfinished projects, more on that below...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Rust lang, HyperComplex Numbers, Hyper Operations, some more math and programming stuff. I wish I dedicated more time to music...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: The ByteAnim project, because I believe this is something the ByteBeat community would love.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Making a graphic equivalent of *ByteBeat*, I named it **ByteAnim**. I also need help processing big files with client-side javascrip without crashing the tab or the browser caused by an OOM error lol.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Advice for refactoring code, especially my main langs (JS & Automate)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My website has a bunch of contact info. The link is on my profile
- âš¤ Pronouns: He/Him/They/Them/Whatever_IDKâ„¢
- âš¡ Fun fact: 5 is one of the only Fibonacci numbers whose value is equal to its index... Oh wait you were expecting a personal fact... I'm still thinking about it ðŸ¤”
