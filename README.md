# About
I'm currently unemployed. Dedicating my time to maintain my repos, and to finish the "base" of some non-posted repos. I’m interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I wish I dedicated more time to music. I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything. I'm willing to contribute to innovative games that explore the concepts of non-Euclidean space/geometry, +3D games like 4D Miner, 1D and 0D games (for completeness lol)
