# About
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Whatever thing I'm inspired to do at the moment. Usually my repos, but there's some stuff I haven't posted because those are unfinished projects, more on that below...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Rust lang, some math and programming stuff. Also interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I wish I dedicated more time to music...
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on: The [ByteAnim](https://github.com/Rudxain/Byte-Anim) project, because I believe this is something the Demoscene community would love. [`xorsum`](https://github.com/Rudxain/xorsum) because it's a simple checksum for the public domain. And I'm willing to contribute to innovative games that explore the concepts of non-Euclidean space/geometry, +3D games like 4D Miner, 1D and 0D games (for completeness lol)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: Making a graphic equivalent of *ByteBeat*, I named it **ByteAnim**. And optimizing `xorsum`, because it's slower than MD5 on my machine
- 💬 Ask me about: Advice for refactoring code, especially my main langs (Javascript & Llamalab Automate)
- 📫 How to reach me: My website has a bunch of contact info. The link is on my profile
- ⚤ Pronouns: He/Him/They/Them/Whatever_IDK™
- ⚡ Fun fact: 5 is one of the only Fibonacci numbers whose value is equal to its index... Oh wait you were expecting a personal fact... I'm still thinking about it 🤔
