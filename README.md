# Me

## Personal
- Currently doing courses listed by [CIC](https://cincinnatus.edu.do). After I complete the technical-capacitation phase, I'll get my 1st job!
- My home (not my house) is under renovation, so I can't use my dev PC
- Have an "obsession" with code refactoring. It's obvious from my GH activity üòÇ
- Considering leaving GH, [for many reasons](https://gavinhoward.com/2020/04/i-am-moving-away-from-github).
	- The fact that [GL nukes dead accounts](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/#how-does-gitLab-secure-my-personal-data) is a deal-breaker for me.
	- I've just learned about [Code-Berg](https://codeberg.org), it seems interesting.

## Repos
- When my PRs are merged, **I'll delete my corresponding fork**. Therefore, links to any of my forks may be [broken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) (not dead, because it's not permanent) in the future.
	- The exception is [.files](https://github.com/Rudxain/dotfiles)
- I could **delete any of [my Gists](https://gist.github.com/Rudxain) without warning**
- All my repos use [semver](https://semver.org)
	- except the ones that don't use versioning at all
- If I contribute to any of your repos, I hope you do the same for me and/or other people :)

## Langs
- ‚ù§Favorites
	- in practice:
	This takes into account all the stuff related to the langs (portability, std+community tools & libraries, ecosystem, documentation, etc...):
	
		0. <img src=https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/files/python-logo-only.svg width=16em height=16em loading=lazy>Python
		1. JavaScript
		2. ü¶ÄRust
			- I love its _honesty_: It has abstractions (like any other lang), but they are **[leaky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions) by design**.
			> [Rust \[is\] both as low-level as C, and as high-level as Lisp, whereas most other popular languages are stuck somewhere in the middle.](https://github.com/0atman/noboilerplate/blob/1eab51863994129b0c31f1d6925c5bd6299f4dc9/scripts/03-rust-turtles-all-the-way-down.md) 
		4. POSIX Shell

	- in theory:
	This **only** takes into account the langs [in isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow) (syntax, grammar, stdlib, etc...):
	
		0. ü¶ÄRust. For everything.
		1. <img src=https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/files/python-logo-only.svg width=16em height=16em loading=lazy>Python. For expressing algorithms, because "haha, pseudo-code".
			- My favorite argument against [Python's colons](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-are-colons-required-for-the-if-while-def-class-statements) is this:
			> > _The colons are an extra visual clue to scanning the blocks. As such, they improve readability, one of Python's main strengths._
			> 
			> [Then Opening and closing braces should be called an "extra visual clue to scanning the block" in C++ and Java? Because they improved readability. Braces (`{`) then is C++, Java's main Strength.](https://wiki.c2.com/?SyntacticallySignificantWhitespaceConsideredHarmful)
			
			As a logician, I love the way they point out the fallacy!
		3. üïäAda
			- I fell in love with it, since it makes a [distinction between subroutines and functions](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/chapters/subprograms.html), and [supports ranged-ints](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/chapters/strongly_typed_language.html#integers) out-of-the-box. It even statically checks ranges at the type-system level! something that [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/language-reference/index.html#integers) does, but Rust and TS don't do it at all:
			```ada
			-- 32bit target architecture
			type Integer is range -(2 ** 31) .. +(2 ** 31 - 1);
			-- I love this so much that I hate Py and Rust in comparison üò≠
			```
		4. Any lang that uses symbols rather than words (such as BrainFuck dialects), specially if the symbols have shapes that intuitively correspond to their operation.

- üß†Expertise: This takes into account my knowledge of the lang (and everything related), and the experience making useful, efficient, and safe programs in it.
This is subject to the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) üòÇ, I'll try my best to list in an accurate order. Fluency Threshold ‚âà 4:
